System Requirements

MicroTESK is a set of Java-based utilities that are run from the command line.
It can be used on Windows, Linux and OS X machines that have JDK 1.7 or later
installed. To build MicroTESK from source code or to build generated Java
models, Apache Ant version 1.8 or later is required. To generate test data
based on constraints, MicroTESK needs Microsoft Research Z3 that can work under
the corresponding operating system.

Installation Steps

1. Download from http://forge.ispras.ru/projects/microtesk/files and unpack
   the MicroTESK installation package (the .tar.gz file, latest release) to
   your computer.

2. [Not required for MicroTESK 2.1 beta] Download and install constraint solver
   tools to the <installation dir>/tools directory (see the "tools/README"
   document for details).

3. Declare the MICROTESK_HOME environment variable and set its value to the path
   to the installation directory(see the Setting Environment Variables section).

4. Set the <installation dir>/bin as the working directory (add the path to the
   PATH environment variable) to be able to run MicroTESK utilities from any
   path.

5. Now you can run the compile.sh (or .bat) script to create a microprocessor
   model and the generate.sh (or .bat) script to generate tests for this model.

Setting Environment Variables

Windows:

1. Open the "System Properties" window.
2. Switch to the "Advanced" tab.
3. Click on Environment Variables.
4. Click "New.." under "System Variables".
5. In the "New System Variable" dialog specify variable name as MICROTESK_HOME
   and variable value as <instrallation dir>.
6. Click "OK" on all open windows.
7. Reopen the command prompt window.

Linux and OS X:

Add the command below to the ~.bash_profile (Linux) or ~/.profile (OS X) file:

export MICROTESK_HOME=<installation dir>

To start editing the file, type vi ~/.bash_profile (or vi ~/.profile). Changes
will be applied after restarting the command-line terminal or reboot. You can 
also execute the command in your command-line terminal to make temporary
changes.

Installation Directory Structure

The MicroTESK installation directory contains the following subdirectories:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| arch | Examples of microprocessor specifications and test templates for the  |
|      | described designs                                                     |
| bin  | Scripts to run features of MicroTESK (modeling and test generation)   |
| doc  | Documentation on MicroTESK                                            |
| etc  | MicroTESK configuration files                                         |
| gen  | Generated Java models of the specified microprocessor designs         |
| lib  | JAR files and Ruby scripts to perform modeling and test generation    |
|      | tasks                                                                 |
| src  | Source code of MicroTESK                                              |

Running MicroTESK

To generate a Java model of a microprocessor from its nML specification, a user
needs to run the compile.sh script (Unix, Linux, OS X) or the compile.bat
script (Windows). For example, the following command generates a model for
the miniMIPS specification:

sh bin/compile.sh arch/minimips/model/minimips.nml

NOTE: Models for all demo specifications are already built and included in the
MicroTESK distribution package. So a user can start working with MicroTESK from
generating test programs for these models.

To generate a test program, a user needs to use the generate.sh script (Unix,
Linux, OS X) or the generate.bat script (Windows). The scripts require the
following parameters:

1. model name;
2. test template file;
3. target test program source code file.

For example, the following command runs the euclid.rb test template for the
miniMIPS model generated by the command from the previous example and saves
the generated test program to the test.asm file:

sh bin/generate.sh minimips arch/minimips/templates/euclid.rb test.asm
