# Description:
#
# This test template demonstrates how MicroTESK handles data dependencies between
# instructions when generating test data. Data generated for previous instructions
# in the same instruction sequence is taken into account (reused) when data is being
# generated for an instruction accessing the same resource (e.g. register).
