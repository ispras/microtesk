# Description:
#
# This test template demonstrates how MicroTESK can simulate the execution
# of a test program to predict the resulting state of a microprocessor
# design under test. The described program calculates the greatest common
# divisor of two 5-bit random numbers ([1..63]) by using the Euclidean
# algorithm.
