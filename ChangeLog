 MicroTESK is an open-source framework for generating test programs for
 microprocessors. It is customized for a specific microprocessor architecture
 with formal specifications in nML/Sim-nML. Test programs are generated on a
 basis of test templates, which are abstract descriptions of test scenarios.
 Flexible and convenient Ruby-based test template language allows creating a
 wide range of tests (from random to directed) with minimal efforts.
