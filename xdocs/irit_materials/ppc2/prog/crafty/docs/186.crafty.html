<H2>Benchmark Program General Category</H2>
<P>Game playing program (plays chess)</P>
<HR>

<H2>Benchmark Description</H2>
<P>Crafty is a high-performance Computer Chess program that is designed 
 around a 64-bit word.  It runs on 32 bit machines using the "long long" 
 (or similar, as _int64 in Microsoft C) data type.  It is primarily an 
 integer code, with a significant number of logical operations such as 
 and, or, exclusive or and shift.  It can be configured to run a 
 reproducible set of searches to compare the integer/branch 
 prediction/pipe-lining facilities of a processor.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Input Description</H2>
<P>The reference input solves 5 different chess board layouts, with 
 varying "depths" to which it will search the tree of possible moves, 
 for the next move.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Output Description</H2>
<P>The output consists of the set of moves possible at 
 each level of the tree of possible moves, upto the maximum depth as set 
 by the input parameter. At each level, the best possible move is selected
 to begin the search at the next level.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Programming Language</H2>
<P>Crafty is written in ANSI C.</P>
<HR>

<H2>Known portability issues</H2>
<P>186.crafty is based on a 64-bit variable. On 32-bit systems, this is 
 usually defined as "long long", which is an extension to ANSI C.</P> 

<P>The following sets of defines need to be defined or undefined for 
 186.crafty, based on the nature of your system:</P> 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>LONG_HAS_64BITS</STRONG> -- if the data type "long [int]" is represented in 64 bits, either as the compiler's default option or by an appropriate switch(e.g. -Klp64)
<LI><STRONG>HAS_LONGLONG</STRONG> -- if the C compilation system supports the data type "long long"(which is an extension to ANSI C) and represents data of this type with 64 bits
<LI><STRONG>LITTLE_ENDIAN_ARCH</STRONG> -- if the machine stores bytes in "PC" order        
<LI><STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> -- if the system is unix-based   
</UL>

<P>chess.h has ready-made combinations of defines and undefines for
 several common platforms.</P>
